    "Build a classifier however you see fit. You may want build one and tweak the paramters manually or use some sort of grid search to look through all possible parameters. \n",

    "Remember: The same model built on the massaged data may perform better than if the data was untouched. It may be more conveniant to chose a standared massaging pipeline and tweak a model to that data.\n",
